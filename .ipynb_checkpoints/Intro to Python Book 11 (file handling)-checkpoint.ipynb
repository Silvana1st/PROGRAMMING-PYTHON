Then we have a number of folders separated by slashes. On some operating systems the slashes may be the other way around. In this example, on the hard drive <code>C</code>, there is a folder called <code>Users</code>, within this, another folder called <code>Alan_Davies</code>, then a folder called <code>NLP</code> which contains the file <code>alan.PNG</code>. The other point to note is the letters that come after the dot (period) in a file name. This is referred to as the <code>file extension</code> and determines what type of file it is. In this case it's an image, specifically a Portable Network Graphic (PNG). You may be familiar with other types of file such as a word document <code>.docx</code> or a Portable Document Format (PDF) file <code>.pdf</code> and so on.

I send these notebooks to someone who uploads them onto a server. The path could be quite different in this case. It might for example be: <code>E:\\data_files\\teaching\\FBMH\\SHS\\intro_programming\\file_handling\\Something in the way.txt</code>. This is where the power of relative paths comes in.

      "The heart is located in the chest between the lungs in the mediastinum. It is surrounded by a protective sac called the pericardium (figure 1.1). Essentially the heart is split into four functional chambers; a left and right atrium, and a left and right ventricle (figure 1.2). Deoxygenated blood (blood with no oxygen in it) is emptied into the right atrium via the vena cava. The inferior vena cava returns blood from the lower portion of the body as the superior vena cava returns blood from the higher portion. This blood is then pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. Blood is then passed into the lungs via the pulmonary artery where it is oxygenated. Oxygenated blood then returns from the lungs into the left atrium where it can be pumped to the rest of the body by the powerful left ventricle, via the aorta (figure 1.3). The cells responsible for the contraction of the heart muscle are called myocytes. Apart from the hearts mechanical function as a pump it also has an electrical system governing the rate at which the heart beats, controlling in turn how slow or fast the blood and oxygen gets pumped to all the organs and tissues in the body.\n",

      "In addition to the myocyte cells, there are also specialised conduction cells in the heart. These cells possess a quality know as automaticity. This is the ability to spontaneously depolarise via an electromechanical gradient. Depolarisation is a process where by a resting cell becomes gradually more positively charged (figure 1.4). This is accomplished by a sudden influx of positively charged sodium and calcium  ions into the cell Alternatively, Repolarisation is the returning of the cell to its resting state following a brief refractory (recovery) period.\n",

      "These specialised conduction cells are distributed throughout the heart forming specialised conduction pathways (figure 1.5). Depolarisation occurs in the Sinoatrial node (SAN). This is a collection of self-excitory (pacemaker) cells that normally fire at a rate of between 60-100 Beats Per Minute (BPM). The “wave” of Depolarisation moves from the SAN through an intra-atrial tract called Bachmanns bundle into the left atrium and to the Atrioventricular (AV) node. From here the impulse travels down the bundle of His into the right and Left bundle branches and finally into the Purkinje fibres activating the ventricles.\n",

      "We will now examine the components of the conduction system in isolation to better understand their function. It is also worth noting that every cell in the conduction system can act as a pacemaker when called upon to do so. This provides a backup system should the SAN fail.

      "What is an ECG and how are they recorded?\n",
      "The ECG, short for electrocardiogram is a graphical representation of the electrical activity generated by the heart. This can be of help in diagnosing or supporting the presence of cardiac rhythm disturbances, structural heart disease, acute cardiac emergencies and a variety of other medical conditions. The ECG is a cheap and easily repeatable test. The wide availability of the ECG means that it is available outside of cardiology areas, and is now found on many general wards, GP surgeries and other clinical areas. Electrical activity from the heart is picked up by cables called leads that are attached to a patient. The electrical activity of the heart muscle is then represented by the ECG machine on pre-printed graph paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Patient positioning\n",
      "Prior to recording a 12-lead ECG, the procedure should be explained to the patient and the patient’s consent obtained (figure 1.10). The patient should then be laid back at an angle of around 30 to 45 degrees. This helps to open up the intercostal spaces, allowing easier placement of the electrodes. If the patient is in any other position, including sitting upright, it should be documented on the ECG i.e. ‘recorded with patient sitting upright’. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes it is necessary to prepare the skin prior to attaching electrodes. If there is visible dirt (blood, soil, water, oil, etc.) this should be removed prior to obtaining a recording. If the patient is perspiring, the adhesion of the electrodes may be affected. In this case an alcohol wipe (or soap and water) can be used to clean the area. It may also be necessary to shave off any excessive chest hair, to ensure better adhesion of the electrodes.\n",

      "Prior to attaching the electrodes and ensuring good patient position, all clothing on the top half of the body should be removed. The trousers\n",
      "can be rolled up to allow access to the legs. If the patient is wearing any tights they should also be removed prior to attaching electrodes. The skin is then prepared as necessary (as discussed earlier).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2\n",
      "First start by attaching the limb electrodes to the arms and legs. When attaching the electrodes to the legs it helps to place them with the tab facing\n",
      "towards the torso so the cables don’t pull (figures 1.12 and 1.13).\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3\n",
      "The electrodes can then be attached to the torso, starting with V1, which is placed in the fourth intercostal space, just to the right of the sternum.\n",
      "Electrodes should be placed with the middle of the electrode in the middle of the intercostal space.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the problems with the position of V1 is that practitioners sometimes miscount the number of intercostal spaces due to the gap between the clavicle and the start of the rib cage. To avoid this, the patient’s sternum can be felt from the top down until contact is made with the ‘angle of Louis’ (figure 1.14). From here, the fourth intercostal space can be located by feeling diagonally down from the bottom of this point by two intercostal spaces.\n",

The V4 electrode is placed in the 5th intercostal space in line with the middle of the clavicle (figure 1.15) this is normally located approximately just under the left nipple.\n",
      "\n",

If the breast tissue is relatively thin or there is a considerable breast droop, then the electrodes may be placed on top of the breast. In most cases and certainly with younger women the electrodes are placed in exactly the same positions, with the exception of V4 which is placed under the breast, taking due care to maintain dignity and seek consent prior to placement. The cables can then be attached to the electrode pads.\n",
